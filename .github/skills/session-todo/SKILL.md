# Session Todo

One command that answers "where are we?" — render the session's running state as
a single nicely formatted todo list: the prioritized list
[`session-overview`](../session-overview/SKILL.md) generated at kickoff, any
items added mid-session by [`session-update`](../session-update/SKILL.md), and
the notes captured by [`session-note`](../session-note/SKILL.md). Everything
comes from the **session scratchpad** (see `session-update` for the file's
location and skeleton): `.claude/session-notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md` in the workspace
root. Formerly named `session-checklist`.

## When to Use

- @jwildfire asks "session todo", "show the list", "what's left", or wants the
  running state after adding or finishing items.
- After a batch of work, to confirm what's still open this session.

**Do not use** to *regenerate* the priorities — that is `session-overview`,
which sweeps the live roadmap and re-persists the list. This skill only renders
what the scratchpad already holds.

## Procedure

1. **Check off first, if asked** — if the request (or the argument) names
   finished items, mark them in the scratchpad, in whichever section they live
   (`## Overview` or `## Todo`):

   ```markdown
   - [x] {item} *(done HH:MM)*
   ```

   Check off, never delete.
2. **Read the scratchpad** — today's file, plus any recent files with unchecked
   items (a session that ended without a wrapup leaves stragglers).
3. **Render one formatted list**, top to bottom:

   - A one-line status summary: `N open / M done`.
   - **The kickoff priorities** (`## Overview`) as a markdown task list, keeping
     the numbering and the two groups — *Agent-actionable* and *Waiting on
     @jwildfire* — from `session-overview`.
   - **Mid-session additions** (`## Todo`), unchecked first; carry-over items
     from earlier files labeled with their date.
   - **Notes** (`## Notes`) as a short trailing section — context, not
     checkboxes. A note that clearly refers to a specific item renders with that
     item instead.

   If the scratchpad has no `## Overview` yet, render what exists and point to
   `session-overview` to seed the priorities; if there is no scratchpad at all,
   say so and point to `session-overview` / `session-update`.

Render-only otherwise: this skill never adds items (that is `session-update`),
never regenerates priorities (that is `session-overview`), and never gives todos
durable homes (that is [`session-wrapup`](../session-wrapup/SKILL.md)).
