# Decision artifacts

When an autonomous session hits a call it cannot make — an unsigned design, a
clinical judgement, a policy carve-out, a missing prerequisite — it does not stall
and it does not guess. It writes a **decision artifact** here and moves on to the
rest of its work.

The contract comes from the [release-candidate framework](https://github.com/jwildfire/obot.agent/blob/main/docs/rc-framework.md)
(obot.agent, 2026-08-14). @jwildfire reviews exactly two kinds of thing: release-candidate
PRs, and these.

## The contract

- One folder per decision at `reports/decisions/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/`, containing a
  self-contained `index.html` (no external assets) and a `README.md` recording
  provenance, sources and assumptions.
- Contents of the page, in order: **the situation in three sentences**; **the options**,
  each with what it costs and what it forecloses; **a recommendation, stated plainly**;
  and **what unblocks** on each choice.
- Linked from the blocked goal's hub issue, and surfaced in that night's executive
  summary under *Critical blockers*.
- **Posted to the hub's [Q&A discussions](https://github.com/jwildfire/obot.roadmap/discussions/categories/q-a)**
  (@jwildfire, 2026-08-14): a *brief* executive summary — the open question, the
  options in a line each, and the recommendation — linking the artifact for the
  full argument, never restating it in markdown. The discussion thread is the
  *place*: @jwildfire documents his decision there, and the thread link goes in
  the Index below and in the roadmap page's Todo section.
- **One artifact per decision topic.** Bundling unrelated questions into one page
  defeats the purpose; a single page may carry several decisions only when they gate
  each other and must be answered in one sitting.
